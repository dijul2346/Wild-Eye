Human-wildlife conflict raises a significant challenge in human settlements close to forests. The issue not only threatens human life and property but also affects wildlife conservation activities . The project aims to develop a system for detecting and identifying wild animals like tiger,elephant etc which raises threat towards human life and property when they venture close to human settlements. The system utilises a Yolo V8 model for detection and classification of wild animal and open cv for real time detection.YOLO v8 is preferred as it is provides high accuracy and speed while being lightweight and easy integration with opencv and other platforms. An Email based alert system is provided along with an flutter based app for alerts .The application also provides features for user reporting as well as access to contact details and relevant informations
